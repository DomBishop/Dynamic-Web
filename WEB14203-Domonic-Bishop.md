## Research

### [The Article that influenced the direction we went in for this project!](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold)

### Mozilla Festival feedback

At the Mozilla Festival we gained some valuable feedback on our app concept. We showed people our app demo video, and they gave us feedback that varied from user interaction options to how the app could be made to work.

We met some members of the Mozilla club at another university, they suggested that we look at screen readers that blind people use to navigate websites. Screen readers have to inspect and decipher the elements of a page, and feed it back to a user so they understand it. We could use this technology to try and uncover how social media apps track your activity.

All the other feedback we got consisted of interface and interaction suggestions. One person suggested that a user should be able to choose when they are notified, constant notifications would get annoying quickly. This then led to the realisation that telling people after they had just lost their data, was shutting the barn doors after the horse has bolted. Instead a user could have a pop up notification saying “you are just about to tell Facebook so and so”, and then the user could decide for themselves if they wanted to continue.

## Moodboard

### [This is the moodboard for the Canary app](https://pin.it/dc2mokrwonnfop)

For Canary, I tried to look at interfaces that had good infographics because that’s integral to the apps purpose. The user needs to understand the data they’re seeing for them to really think about what it is social media apps are taking from us as users.

### [This is the moodboard for the fake Facebook user finder app](https://pin.it/tzdovi2oyvwfvr)

The fake Facebook app was designed with the intention of looking like a Facebook product, and the moodboard reflects that.
